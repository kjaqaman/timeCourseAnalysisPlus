%REMOVESPLITMERGEARTIFACTSCHRONOLOGICALLUCIANA remove potentially artifactual merges and

% SYNOPSIS  seqOfEvents  = removeSplitMergeArtifactsChronologicalLuciana(seqOfEventsIn,replaceSegNum,timeThreshold)
%
% INPUT
%       seqOfEventsIn     :   Matrix with number of rows equal to number
%                              of events happening in a compound track and 4
%                              columns:
%                              1st: Frame where event happens;
%                              2nd: 1 = start of track segment, 2 = end of track segment;
%                              3rd: Index of track segment that ends or starts;
%                              4th: NaN = start is a birth and end is a death,
%                                   number = start is due to a split, end
%                                   is due to a merge, number is the index
%                                   of track segment for the merge/split.
%
%     
% OUTPUT
%          seqOfEvents     : the seqOfEvents after the possible artifacts
%          are identified. The situations that are taken into account are:
%          1) a merge followed by a split;
%          2) a merge of a segment that just appeared
%          3) a split followed by a remerge
%          4) a split followed by a vanishing
